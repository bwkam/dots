# My NixOS Dotfiles

Welcome to my cursed dotfiles. (still under development)


## TODO (just for me, because I have a very bad memory)
- [ ] Add multiple home/system configs
- [ ] Change tmux mappings (Alt)
- [x] Make it more modular
- [x] Move to dwm
- [ ] Integrate lazy-nvim (see ghpzin's comments in the HM matrix server)
